# Buncha Flowers
I designed this flower app as part of my Mobile App Development module in college. 
The idea behind the app is that a flower enthusiast can add flowers and information about that flower as seen in the sample image below.
As anyone who has done any kind of gardening will know, keeping flowers alive and happy is no easy task, so having handy tips and 
information about your favourite flowers can hopefully help gardeners achieve this. They can also view images of flowers in the image gallery. 
I have incorporated Google maps functionality with locations of nearby gardens pinned that may be of interest to the app user too.

**1. List of flowers and search functionality**  
All previously added flowers will be displayed on app startup as there is basic local persistence functionality.
The add button enables the user to add a new flower to the list and all fields need to be filled out before a flower can be saved.
A user can also search for a flower using the search icon in the menu bar.    
*There needs to be images stored on the emulator before adding new flowers, otherwise there will be no images to choose from and a user must add an image to be able to create a new flower item.*

**2. Flower information and edit functionality**  
When a flower is clicked on in the list of of flowers, the flower information entered by the user is displayed. 
The user can also edit the flower name, description and image or delete the flower by clicking on the edit button in the menu bar.

**3. Image gallery of flowers**  
The image gallery can be found on the homepage in the explandable menu options. 
Each image in the gallery can be clicked on to bring up the image and image title in full screen, as seen in the screenshot below.
Images can be viewed in full screen also, by clicking and dragging left or right. 
To exit from the full screen display the back button on the device must be pressed which then returns to the image gallery.

**4. Built in Google maps functionality linking to Google Maps on device**  
The map can be found on the homepage in the expandable menu options. 
Upon loading, the map shows the users location and displays their address.
The map also displays garden locations thay may be of interest to the app user, and the address of these gardens is displayed when each marker is clicked. 
The map can also be zoomed in and out using the buttons on the bottom right corner.
When a marker is clicked, the Google Maps icon appears at the bottom of the screen, and when clicked the Google Map official app 
launches pointing to that garden location.
